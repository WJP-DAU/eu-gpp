/* Allison's notes:
- City needs to be in English
- A5 got weird - instead of yes/no the answer choices are birth certificate or ID card, like the two questions somehow got smushed together -- double-check with D3 that it's just a labeling issue (the numerical options are still 1 and 2, as they should be, but for A5_2, most people responded with choice 2).
