Description:
Data wrangling cleaning and harmonization routine for the COUNRTY_NAME pretest data received on DD/MM/YYYY.

This dofile follows the guidelines in the GPP Cleaning and Validation Protol for the EU-S Project. Please feel 
free to use the EU Copilot app (https://eu-copilot.streamlit.app/) to support your routine writing, consult the
protocol guidelines and use the interactive codebook tool.

					NUTS Regions variables
=================================================================================================================*/

/* Note:
	Please create the following two variables:
		- nuts_ltn: 	Official name of the subnational NUTS region according to the 2022 edition of the 
						Statistical regions in the European Union and partner countries document. Name is 
						registered using the Latin alphabet. For example, in Greece we have:
							- Nisia Aigaiou, Kriti
							- Voreia Ellada
		- nuts_id: 		ID code of the subnational NUTS region according to the 2022 edition of the Statistical 
						regions in the European Union and partner countries document. For example, in Greece 
						we have "EL3", "EL4", "EL5", and "EL6".
						
		Be careful with the REGION variable. According to the datamap, this is supposed to be the admin division
		of the country. Which is not necessarilly the same as the NUTS division. For example, in Greece, there
		are 13 admin regions, which are equivalent to the NUTS 2. However, nuts_ltn and nuts_id are at the
		NUTS 1 level according to the sampling plan. So, be careful. If you don't know, ask.
		TIP: Check the pretest report form to check the names and distributions of "nuts_ltn" and "nuts_id"
		Please check that the whole sample has values for income. Even if someone refuses to answer it or to take this question, it should be flagged in this variable. 
		Always make sure that the income quintiles are ordered from lowest to highest. If there are more than 5 quintiles, please group them.
		NOTE FOR CARLOS: THIS IS THE COMMAND YOU ALWAYS FORGET:
			numlabel, add

/* Note:
	When applicable, remember to decode (convert variables to string) the following variables:
		- income_cur
		- income_time
		- q17
		- City
		- Region
		- Strata / PSU / SSU
		- ethni / relig / paff2 (only for the pretest)
		- rol open ended questions
	
	- Also check their values and labels. 
	- Please standardize the DK/NA values for income, income_cur, income_time to (No need for pretest):
		- "Don't know"
		- "No Answer"
	- Please check that the DK/NA values for q33b, q38e, q38f, q38g_1, q38h_1, and Income2 are encoded as:
		- "Don't know" = -8888
		- "No Answer"  = -9999
	- Check the values for q17, they should be equal to the problem code: A2, A3, B1, L2, etc. This is VERY 
	IMPORTANT for the A2J problem selection checks.
	- Check that multiple choice questions (q14, q21, q36) are correctly encoded as binary (1 | 2)
	- Make sure that the interview lenght is in minutes
